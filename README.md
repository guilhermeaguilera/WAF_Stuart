Check Point CloudGuard AppSec demo
This is a simple docker-compose environment for deploying a Check Point CloudGuard AppSec demo.
It will deploy two containers, an NGINX reverse proxy with embedded nano-agent and the OWASP JuiceShop app.

You will have two ways to access the stack:

Port 80: Protected by AppSec
Port 3000: Direct to JuiceShop (unprotected)
Instructions:
Make sure you have docker (or equivalent) installed and also docker-compose. (Newer format 'docker compose' commands should work too)
Clone the repository
If you are planning to use a DNS entry for your hostname - you'll need to pass this in the .env file.
Add the token from your AppSec profile to the .env file.
Run the following commands from within your appsec-demo directory:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
[DEMO HERE]

docker-compose down
Notes:

The NGINX config requires you to provide a host header otherwise you'll get a 404. The host header (eg, entry in your host file) should be juiceshop.local
